Find Middle of Circular Doubly Linked List  ->
------------------------------------------


Given a circular doubly linked list of odd size n, the task is to print the middle element.
The tail of a circular doubly linked list is connected to head via its next pointer, and the previous pointer of head is connected to the tail.

Example 1:

Input:
LinkedList: 1<-->2<-->3
(The first and the last node is connected,
i.e 3 <--> 1)
Output: 2
Your Task:
The task is to complete the function findMiddle() which takes head reference as an argument. The function should return the middle element of CDLL. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 <= Number of nodes <= 103
