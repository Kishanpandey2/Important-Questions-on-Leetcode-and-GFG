Count the number of possible triangles  =>
---------------------------------------


Given an unsorted array arr[] of n positive integers. Find the number of triangles that can be formed with three different array elements as lengths of three sides of triangles. 

Example 1:

Input: 
n = 3
arr[] = {3, 5, 4}
Output: 
1
Explanation: 
A triangle is possible 
with all the elements 5, 3 and 4.
Example 2:

Input: 
n = 5
arr[] = {6, 4, 9, 7, 8}
Output: 
10
Explanation: 
There are 10 triangles
possible  with the given elements like
(6,4,9), (6,7,8),...
 

Your Task: 
This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function findNumberOfTriangles() that takes arr[] and n as input parameters and returns the count of total possible triangles.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n2).
Expected Space Complexity: O(1).

Constraints:
3 <= n <= 103
1 <= arr[i] <= 103
