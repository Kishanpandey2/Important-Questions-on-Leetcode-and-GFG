Digits In Factorial =>
--------------------




Given an integer N. Find the number of digits that appear in its factorial. 
Factorial is defined as, factorial(n) = 1*2*3*4……..*N and factorial(0) = 1.
 

Example 1:

Input: N = 5
Output: 3
Explanation: Factorial of 5 is 120.
Number of digits in 120 is 3 (1, 2, and 0)
 

Example 2:

Input: N = 120
Output: 199
Explanation: The number of digits in
120! is 199

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function digitsInFactorial() that takes N as input parameter and returns number of digits in factorial of N.


Expected Time Complexity : O(N)
Expected Auxilliary Space : O(1)


Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
