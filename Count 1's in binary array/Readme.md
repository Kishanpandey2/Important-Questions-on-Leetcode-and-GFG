Count 1's in binary array  =>
-------------------------


Given a binary sorted non-increasing array of 1s and 0s. You need to print the count of 1s in the binary array.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 8
arr[] = {1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0}
Output: 5
Explanation: Number of 1's in given 
binary array : 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 is 5.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 8
arr[] = {1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0}
Output: 2
Explanation: Number of 1's in given 
binary array : 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 is 2.
Your Task:
The task is to complete the function countOne() which takes the array arr[] and its size N as inputs and returns the count of 1s in the input array.

Expected Time Complexity: O(LogN).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraint:
1 <= N <= 5*106
arr[i] = 0,1
