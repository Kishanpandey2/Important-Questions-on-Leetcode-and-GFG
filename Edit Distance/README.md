Edit Distance =>
-------------



Given two strings s and t. Return the minimum number of operations required to convert s to t.
The possible operations are permitted:

Insert a character at any position of the string.
Remove any character from the string.
Replace any character from the string with any other character.
 

Example 1:

Input: 
s = "geek", t = "gesek"
Output: 1
Explanation: One operation is required 
inserting 's' between two 'e's of str1.
Example 2:

Input : 
s = "gfg", t = "gfg"
Output: 
0
Explanation: Both strings are same.
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function editDistance() which takes strings s and t as input parameters and returns the minimum number of operation to convert the string s to string t. 


Expected Time Complexity: O(|s|*|t|)
Expected Space Complexity: O(|s|*|t|)


Constraints:
1 ≤ Length of both strings ≤ 100
Both the strings are in lowercase.
