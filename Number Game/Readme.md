-----------


Given a number n the task is to find the minimum number which is divisible by all numbers from 1 to n. Print the answer modulo (109+7).

 

Example 1:

Input:
n = 3
Output:
6 
Explanation:
When n = 3 then the minimum number
that is divisible by all the number
till 3 is 6.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 4
Output:
12
Explanation:
When n = 4 then the minimum number
that is divisible by all the number
till 4 is 12.
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function numGame() which takes an Integer n as input and returns the answer.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(n*log(n))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 105
