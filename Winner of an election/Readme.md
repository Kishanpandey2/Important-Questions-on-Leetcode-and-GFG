Winner of an election  =>
---------------------


Given an array of names (consisting of lowercase characters) of candidates in an election. A candidate name in array represents a vote casted to the candidate. Print the name of candidate that received Max votes. If there is tie, print lexicographically smaller name.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 13
Votes[] = {john,johnny,jackie,johnny,john 
jackie,jamie,jamie,john,johnny,jamie,
johnny,john}
Output: john 4
Explanation: john has 4 votes casted for 
him, but so does johny. john is 
lexicographically smaller, so we print 
john and the votes he received.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 3
Votes[] = {andy,blake,clark}
Output: andy 1
Explanation: All the candidates get 1 
votes each. We print andy as it is 
lexicographically smaller.
Your Task:
You only need to complete the function winner() that takes an array of strings arr, and n as parameters and returns the name of the candiate with maximum votes and the number of votes the candidate got as an array of size 2.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 105
