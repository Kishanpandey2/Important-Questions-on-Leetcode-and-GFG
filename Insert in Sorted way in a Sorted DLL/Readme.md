Insert in Sorted way in a Sorted DLL =>
------------------------------------


Given a sorted doubly linked list and an element x, you need to insert the element x into the correct position in the sorted Doubly linked list(DLL).

Note: The DLL is sorted in ascending order

Example:

Input: LinkedList: 3->5->8->10->12 , x = 9

Output: 3->5->8->9->10->12

Explanation: Here node 9 is inserted in the Doubly Linked-List.
Input: LinkedList: 1->4->10->11 , x = 15

Output: 1->4->10->11->15

Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 <= number of nodes <= 103
1 <= node -> data , x <= 104
