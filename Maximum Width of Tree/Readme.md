Maximum Width of Tree  =>
---------------------


Given a Binary Tree, find the maximum width of it. Maximum width is defined as the maximum number of nodes at any level.
For example, the maximum width of the following tree is 4 as there are 4 nodes at the 3rd level.

          1
       /     \
     2        3
   /    \    /    \
  4    5   6    7
    \
      8

Example 1:

Input:
       1
     /    \
    2      3
Output: 2
On the first level there is only
one node 1
On the second level there are
two nodes 2, 3 clearly it is the 
maximum number of nodes at any level

Example 2:

Input:
        10
      /     \
    20      30
   /    \
  40    60
Output: 2
There is one node on level 1(10)
There is two node on level 2(20, 30)
There is two node on level 3(40, 60)
Hence the answer is 2

Your Task:
You don't have to read any input. Complete the function getMaxWidth() that takes the node as a parameter and returns the maximum width. The driver code does the printing.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Width of the tree).

Constraints:
1 <= Number of Nodes<= 105
0 <= nodes values <= 105
