Exactly 3 Divisors =>
------------------- 

Given a positive integer value N. The task is to find how many numbers less than or equal to N have numbers of divisors exactly equal to 3.

 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: The only number less than 6 with 
3 divisors is 4.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 10
Output: 2
Explanation: 4 and 9 have 3 divisors.
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function exactly3Divisors() that takes N as input parameter and returns count of numbers less than or equal to N with exactly 3 divisors.

 

Expected Time Complexity : O(N1/2 * N1/4)
Expected Auxilliary Space :  O(1)
