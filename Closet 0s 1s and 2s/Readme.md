Closet 0s 1s and 2s  =>
-------------------


Given an array of 0s, 1s, and 2s. Arrange the array elements such that all 0s come first, followed by all the 1s and then, all the 2s.

Note: Do not use the inbuilt sort function.
 

Example 1:

Input: N = 5, arr[] = {0, 2, 1, 2, 0}
Output: 0 0 1 2 2
Example 2:

Input: N = 3, arr[] = {0, 1, 0}
Output: 0 0 1
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function segragate012() which takes the array arr[] and the size of the array as inputs and updates the array arr[] such that all the 0s come before the 1s and all the 1s come before the 2s.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 106
0 <= Ai <= 2
